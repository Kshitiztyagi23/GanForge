\section*{Introduction}
In this project, I built a face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal was to detect if a person is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item wearing a mask properly,
    \item not wearing a mask,
    \item wearing a mask incorrectly (e.g., below the nose).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Dataset}
I used the dataset from Kaggle: \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection}{Face Mask Detection by Andrew Mvd}. It contains images labeled into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item with\_mask
    \item without\_mask
    \item mask\_weared\_incorrect
\end{itemize}

\section*{Data Preprocessing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Images were resized to a fixed size (128x128).
    \item Pixel values were normalized by dividing by 255.
    \item Data was split into training and validation sets.
    \item Used \textbf{ImageDataGenerator} from Keras for easy image loading and preprocessing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Handling Imbalanced Data}
Since there were fewer examples of "mask\_weared\_incorrect", I calculated \textbf{class weights} to give more importance to that class during training.

\section*{Model Architecture}
A simple CNN was used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 convolutional layers with ReLU activation
    \item Max pooling layers
    \item Flatten and Dense layers
    \item Output layer with 3 neurons and softmax activation (for the 3 classes)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Training}
The model was compiled using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loss: categorical\_crossentropy
    \item Optimizer: Adam
    \item Metrics: accuracy
\end{itemize}

I trained the model for 10 epochs using the computed \textbf{class weights} to help the model learn better for under-represented classes.

\section*{Testing and Visualization}
To test the model, I:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detected faces using OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade or MTCNN.
    \item Extracted the face region and passed it to the CNN.
    \item Predicted mask status and displayed the result with bounding boxes and labels.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item False predictions when mask is worn partially.
    \item Some faces not detected properly due to overlapping or blur.
    \item MTCNN sometimes detects multiple overlapping boxes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Future Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for better accuracy.
    \item Add Non-Maximum Suppression to remove duplicate detections.
    \item Train on more balanced data or use oversampling/augmentation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
This was a great beginner-friendly project to understand CNNs, image classification, and handling real-world challenges like imbalanced data and face detection.
